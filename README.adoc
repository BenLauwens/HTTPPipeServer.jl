= HTTPPipeServer

A pure Julia HTTP gateway. Communication with a frontend webserver (eg. Nginx) goes through a named pipe of a Unix domain socket.

```julia
route("GET /helloworld") do req
    """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </html>
    """
end

server = run("/tmp/test.sock")
wait(Condition())
close(server)
```
